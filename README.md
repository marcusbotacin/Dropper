# Dropper

Multiple ways to embed an executable as a PE resource, drop, and launch it in runtime.

Created for educational purposes. Use at your own risk!

## Available Material

* The *filesystem.exe* directory hosts a project for an EXE binary that drops tha payload to the filesystem and creates the process from it.
* The *filesystem.dll* directory hosts a project for a DLL binary that drops tha payload to the filesystem and creates the process from it.
* The *inmemory.dll* directory hosts a project for a DLL binary that drops a payload to a copy of its own process' memory.
* The *inmemory.filesystem.dll* directory hosts a project for a DLL binary that drops a payload to the disk and replace it in memory with another payload also extracted from itself.
* The *bin.samples* directory hosts sample binaries for testing purposes.
* The *utils* directory hosts helper functions.

## Usage

This dropper has been used in my (our) participation in the MLSEC competition [link here](https://mlsec.io/)

The *Adversarial Malware in Machine Learning Detectors: Our MLSEC 2020â€™s SECRETs* blog post describing our 2020's participation is available [here](https://secret.inf.ufpr.br/2020/09/29/adversarial-malware-in-machine-learning-detectors-our-mlsec-2020-secrets/)
